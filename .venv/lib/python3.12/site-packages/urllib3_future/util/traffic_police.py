    This class is made to enforce the 'I will have order!' psychopath philosophy.
    Rational: Recent HTTP protocols handle concurrent streams, therefore it is

    1) we cannot just dispose of the oldest connection/pool, it may have a pending response in it.
    2) we need a map, a dumb and simple GPS, to avoid wasting CPU resources searching for a response (promise resolution).
       - that would permit doing read(x) on one response and then read(x) on another without compromising the concerned
         connection.
       - multiplexed protocols can permit temporary locking of a single connection even if response isn't consumed
         (instead of locking through entire lifecycle single request).

    This program is (very) complex and need, for patches, at least both unit tests and integration tests passing.
